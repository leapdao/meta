## Intro

LeapDAO is an adaptive organization with the purpose to scale Ethereum Dapps without compromising on security. "To scale" here means faster and less expensive Dapps execution.

The current LeapDAO's strategy to achieve that is to develop, launch and foster a general purpose Plasma chain (Leap Network). From the many flavours of Plasma frameworks, we chose More Viable Plasma and Plasma Leap. More Viable Plasma (MVP) design covers simple transfer transactions on plasma chain, while Plasma Leap extension allows off-chain smart contract execution secured by a special challenge game on the root chain.

LeapDAO is broken down into a semi-autonomous Circles, a groups of people around a shared purpose and multisig wallet. Dev Circle is the one of these Circles and is focusing on delivering software to run and use Leap Network.

## Current focus

* Plasma Leap development (integration with SolEVM, watchtowers)
* Improvements to increase adoption of Plasma Leap (spending conditions model)
* Assisting OPS Circle with multioperator/PoS setup
* Creating better environment for Dev Circle developers

Software produced by the circle is currently used by Ops Circle to run the networks (testnet/mainnet). Thus pursuing it's purpose, Ops Circle may request changes to be done in the software.

Software produced by the circle is used Ecosystem Circle to connect to Leap Network. Thus pursuing it's purpose, Ecosystem Circle may request changes to be done in the software.

## Roadmap

| Plasma Leap | Ops Circle Agenda |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| ✅ Transfer-only Plasma chain (Minimum Viable Plasma) | ✅ [Cryptoeconomic Aggregate Signatures](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/9) |
| ✅ More Viable Plasma | 🔄 [All validators should be submitting periods](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/11) |
| ✅ Spending Conditions (offchain execution) | ⬜️ [Validators' connectivity can be proven on plasma](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/12) |
| ✅ SolEVM runtime (single instruction onchain execution) | 🔄 [Watchtowers to monitor CAS and Exits](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/16) |
| ✅ NST PoC | 🔄 [Bonded validators can be slashed](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/13) |
| ✅ SolEVM Enforcer (challenge game) | |
| ⬜️ [Exitable spending conditions (aka "Metaverse")](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/14) | |
| ⬜️ [Better spending conditions](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/17) | |
| ⬜️ [Exact onchain and offchain execution](https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/15) | |

## What to work on

* 🌴 any non-assigned bounty tagged with `Status: Available` from the [Roadmap](#Roadmap) (click on the item to see the list). Those closer to the beggining of the list are better
* 🐞 Something from the [list](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Aleapdao+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22). These will be paid on hourly basis and of second priority.
* ⭐️ anything else you see as aligned with the Dev Circle purpose and focus but not reported on Github. Ask on Slack first.
